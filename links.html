    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <p>You know how sometimes you see Latin-looking placeholder text in documents? Well, you can generate that yourself in Word. But before I explain how, why might you wish to do so in the first place?

        The most common and obvious reason is to see what a particular template or font looks like when it is applied to a body of text. Rather than copying and pasting text from another source, or typing it anew, you can save time by using a built-in macro.
        
        Another reason to want to generate a great deal of text quickly is to get an idea of how a published report or book might look when there are 200 pages of it to bind and handle.
        
        Here’s how you do it:
        
        Type =lorem() and then press the Enter key. That will generate the familiar “lorem ipsum” text.
        
        You can go further, and specify the number of paragraphs to generate, and the number of sentences in each paragraph. Thus the command =lorem(10,4) will generate a body of text comprising 10 paragraphs, each of which contains 4 sentences.
        
        It will, of course, be obvious that in order to generate a vast number of pages you simply need to enter large numbers within the brackets. Much will hinge on the size of your font and the dimensions of the page layout, but experiment. For instance, try entering 200,10 and see how many pages that leads to. If the result is too many or too few, just press Ctrl A and then Delete, and start again!
